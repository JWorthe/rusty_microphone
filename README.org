#+TITLE: Rusty Microphone

* Summary

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard for real-time
feedback to musicians while they are practicing. This is a personal
needs project, and so will at least initially focus only on the
trumpet, and problems that I personally face.

The other goal of this project is to give me a platform for learning
Rust, and various other technologies that I do not get to touch in my
day to day work.

* Getting started

This is a Rust project. The latest version of the Rust compiler and
Cargo are available from your system's package manager, or from
https://www.rust-lang.org/.

To compile the project
src_sh{cargo build}

To compile and run
src_sh{cargo run}

To compile and run unit tests. Use this as the CI build command if
setting up a CI server.
src_sh{cargo test}

* Project structure

** File Structure

- Dependencies are declared in ~Cargo.toml~
- The project main function for the project executable is in
  ~src/main.rs~. This should only be an entry point. Any actual
  functionality should be part of the library build.
- The other files to be included in the build are declared in
  ~src/lib.rs~.
- Unit tests are kept in the same files as the units they are testing.
- The main function will launch the GUI in ~src/gui.rs~. From here,
  the GUI can call out to the other parts of the library as required.

** General Architectural Guidelines

- Try to keep functions pure when possible. If not possible, try to
  isolate the impure parts.
- Split functionality into files based on their logical separation of
  concerns. Try to keep mathematical processing separate from
  presentation logic, so that the processing can be reused
  independently.

* Tasks
** Project setup
*** DONE Cargo build process
- This is probably already in place, since it's 'just use Cargo', but
  it needs to be in the docs mentioned below.
*** DONE Getting started docs
- For myself two months later. This doubles as revision exercise on
  how a Rust project can be laid out.
*** DONE CI build
- it's only me on the project, so manually triggered with a script and
  not actually on a CI server is fine. This is probably just 'use
  Cargo test', but again, formalize and in the docs above.
** Audio interfaces
*** DONE Read the list of microphones.
*** TODO Start listening on a selected microphone, and let other plugins process the signal.
- There needs to be able to be multiple of these, and those listening
  need to be able to be turned on and off independently.
*** TODO Plugin for finding frequency spectrum
*** TODO Plugin for finding fundamental frequencies, expressed as a note and amount sharp/flat
*** TODO Plugin for recording and playback
- During playback, it would be cool if the other plugins can be
  pointed at the sound being played back.
** GUI
*** DONE Opens a window with a drop down of available microphones
*** TODO Real-time updating graph of frequency spectrum
*** TODO Real-time updating graphical representation of fundamental frequency
*** TODO Recording and playback controls
*** TODO Enabling or disabling of plugins and their GUI elements on the fly
- This is necessary because as the project scales, you might want to
  be able to focus on certain areas and hide others, or some things
  may be processor-intensive.
