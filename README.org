#+TITLE: Musician Training

* Summary

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard for real-time
feedback to musicians while they are practicing. This is a personal
needs project, and so will at least initially focus only on the
trumpet, and problems that I personally face.

The other goal of this project is to give me a platform for learning
Rust, and various other technologies that I do not get to touch in my
day to day work.

* Tasks
** Project setup
*** TODO Cargo build process
- This is probably already in place, since it's 'just use Cargo', but
  it needs to be in the docs mentioned below.
*** TODO Getting started docs
- For myself two months later. This doubles as revision exercise on
  how a Rust project can be laid out.
*** TODO CI build
- it's only me on the project, so manually triggered with a script and
  not actually on a CI server is fine. This is probably just 'use
  Cargo test', but again, formalize and in the docs above.
** Audio interfaces
*** TODO Read the list of microphones.
*** TODO Start listening on a selected microphone, and let other plugins process the signal.
- There needs to be able to be multiple of these, and those listening
  need to be able to be turned on and off independently.
*** TODO Plugin for finding frequency spectrum
*** TODO Plugin for finding fundamental frequencies, expressed as a note and amount sharp/flat
*** TODO Plugin for recording and playback
- During playback, it would be cool if the other plugins can be
  pointed at the sound being played back.
** GUI
*** TODO Opens a window with a drop down of available microphones
*** TODO Real-time updating graph of frequency spectrum
*** TODO Real-time updating graphical representation of fundamental frequency
*** TODO Recording and playback controls
*** TODO Enabling or disabling of plugins and their GUI elements on the fly
- This is necessary because as the project scales, you might want to
  be able to focus on certain areas and hide others, or some things
  may be processor-intensive.
