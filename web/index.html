        This is a demo for the web build of Rusty Microphone using
        Emscripten. It requires a browser that supports WebAssembly
        and the Web Audio API. There may still be some rough edges
        that need to be refined. If it does not appear to be working,
        please make sure that you are using the latest version of your
        web browser, since these technologies are still relatively
        new.
